                <p><img src="assets/Gizmo.png" alt="Gizmo" width="310" height="275" class="showLeft">Although Onji is a friendly soul, there is this one cat that he does not get along with. His name is Gizmo. Gizmo and Onji are around the same age. In their first meeting, Gizmo hissed at Onji several times. Onji talked back initially but later on, he stopped trying to be friends with him because Gizmo did not wanted to be friends. Gizmo kept chasing Onji and trying to hit him. On the other hand, Onji instead of confronting Gizmo, he kept running away. It is because Onji does not like fighting. Their humans tried to make them friends but every time Gizmo misbehaved with Onji. So, Onji's humans decided not to try making them friends anymore.<br></p>
