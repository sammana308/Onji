            <!--<br><img src="assets/walking.png" alt="walking" width="310" height="275" class="showLeft">-->
            <p>This is his top favorite activity. He loves going out for walks. He likes walking on grass and eating it. His personality completely changes from sweet and affectionate to wild and feisty when he is outside in the lawn. He starts chasing birds, butterflys and bugs. It is very difficult to bring him inside the house. The only way he can be brought inside is through treats. Even then, he sometimes refuses to go inside the house.</p>
